Overly influenced by the aberrant Microsoft case,3 commentators have misconstrued the roles that state and federal antitrust enforcement officers play.4 This Article seeks to correct these misunderstandings. Part I identifies three consensus comparative <details><summary>[...]</summary>advantages of state enforcers: familiarity with local and regional markets, closeness to state and local institutions, and ability</details> and experience in compensating individuals. Areview of state antitrust enforcement shows that the vast majority of activities (unlike Microsoft) are consistent with one or more of these comparative advantages.

<p class="p2">UN Gen. Ass. Res. 41/128, UN Doc. A/RES/41/128 (1986)</p>
<p class="p3">The General Assembly, Bearing in mind the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations relating to the achievement of international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian nature, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion,</p>
<p class="p3"><em>Recognizing</em> that development is a comprehensive economic, social, cultural and political process, which aims at the constant improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals on the basis of their active, free and meaningful participation in development and in the fair distribution of benefits resulting therefrom,</p>
<p class="p3"><em>Considering</em> that under the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in that Declaration can be fully realized,</p>
<p class="p3"><em>Recalling</em> the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,</p>
<p class="p3"><em>Recalling</em> further the relevant agreements, conventions, resolutions, recommendations and other instruments of the United Nations and its specialized agencies concerning the integral development of the human being, economic and social progress and development of all peoples, including those instruments concerning decolonization, the prevention of discrimination, respect for and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms, the maintenance of international peace and security and the further promotion of friendly relations and co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter,</p>
<p class="p3"><em>Recalling</em> the right of peoples to self-determination, by virtue of which they have the right freely to determine their political status and to pursue their economic, social and cultural development,</p>
<p class="p3"><em>Recalling</em> also the right of peoples to exercise, subject to the relevant provisions of both International Covenants on Human Rights, full and complete sovereignty over all their natural wealth and resources,</p>
<p class="p3"><em>Mindful</em> of the obligation of States under the Charter to promote universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction of any kind such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status,</p>
<p class="p3"><em>Considering</em> that the elimination of the massive and flagrant violations of the human rights of the peoples and individuals affected by situations such as those resulting from colonialism, neo-colonialism, apartheid, all forms of racism and racial discrimination, foreign domination and occupation, aggression and threats against national sovereignty, national unity and territorial integrity and threats of war would contribute to the establishment of circumstances propitious to the development of a great part of mankind,</p>
<p class="p3"><em>Concerned</em> at the existence of serious obstacles to development, as well as to the complete fulfilment of human beings and of peoples, constituted, inter alia, by the denial of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, and considering that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent and that, in order to promote development, equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation, promotion and protection of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights and that, accordingly, the promotion of, respect for and enjoyment of certain human rights and fundamental freedoms cannot justify the denial of other human rights and fundamental freedoms,</p>
<p class="p3"><em>Considering</em> that international peace and security are essential elements for the realization of the right to development,</p>
<p class="p3"><em>Reaffirming</em> that there is a close relationship between disarmament and development and that progress in the field of disarmament would considerably promote progress in the field of development and that resources released through disarmament measures should be devoted to the economic and social development and well-being of all peoples and, in particular, those of the developing countries,</p>
<p class="p3"><em>Recognizing</em> that the human person is the central subject of the development process and that development policy should therefore make the human being the main participant and beneficiary of development,</p>
<p class="p3"><em>Recognizing</em> that the creation of conditions favourable to the development of peoples and individuals is the primary responsibility of their States,</p>
<p class="p3"><em>Aware that </em>efforts at the international level to promote and protect human rights should be accompanied by efforts to establish a new international economic order,</p>
<p class="p3"><em>Confirming</em> that the right to development is an inalienable human right and that equality of opportunity for development is a prerogative both of nations and of individuals who make up nations,</p>
<p class="p3"><em>Proclaims</em> the following Declaration on the Right to Development:</p>
<p class="p3">Article 1</p>
