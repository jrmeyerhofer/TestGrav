justifications mustbe both cognizable under the antitrust laws and at least facially plausible."236 As in Massachusetts Board, "[a] justification is plausible if it cannot be rejected without extensive factual inquiry."237 But thedefendant "must articulate the specific link between the challenged restraintand the purported justification."238

In [Massachusetts Board](www.yahoo.com), if a justification is "plausible," a "third inquiry . . . determine[s] whether the justification is really valid."239 If it is, the restraint is evaluated under the full rule of reason analysis. Again, Polygram is more demanding. If a<a href="test.com"> defendant</a> "advances" a legitimate justification, "the plaintiff must make a more detailed showing that the restraints at issue are indeed likely, in the particular context, to harm competition. Such a showing still need not prove actual anticompetitive effects or entail 'the fullest market analysis.'"240 The showing "may or may notrequire evidence about the particular market at issue, but at a minimummust entail the identification of the theoretical basis for the alleged anticompetitive effects and a showing that the effects are indeed likely to be anticompetitive."241 It could "be based on a more detailed analysis of economic learning about the likely competitive effects of a particular restraint," on a showing "that the proffered procompetitive effects could be achieved through means less restrictive of competition."242 Most notably, if the plaintiff "address[es] the justification, and provide[s] the tribunal with sufficient evidence to show that anticompetitive effects are in fact likely," then"the evidentiary burden shifts to the defendant."243

Note how much tougher Polygram is than Massachusetts Board. In Massachusetts Board, a "plausible" justification was sufficient. Now, only a "legitimate" one will suffice, i.e., one that is both "plausible" and "cognizable." In Massachusetts Board, finding a justification"plausible" leaves only one remaining inquiry -- whether the justificationis "valid" -- with a positive answer triggering the full rule of reason.In Polygram, a finding of legitimacy results in a more detailed inquiry,but that inquiry can focus exclusively on theory and need not necessarilyinclude evidence about the market at issue. It is not clear that the fullrule of reason ever would be found to apply.

Whether or not Polygram will be upheld on appeal, and whether or not its particular approach will prevail over time at the Commission orin the courts, the litigation has already contributed to the developmentof doctrine by focusing attention on a series of challenging issues. Thebriefs and the oral argument before the Commission found talented lawyersjoining issue on several of the issues left uncertain by California DentalAss'n -- ancillarity, inference of competitive effects, the contextfor evaluating restraints, and the standard for evaluating procompetitivejustifications. These issues, and the Commission's resolution of same, justifycareful attention.

First, for an otherwise problematic restraint to avoid the per se rule, it must have some relation to something like legitimate integration.244 Complaint counsel would have limited this to where a restraint is "necessary to facilitate the procompetitive integration."245 Respondentschampioned a more permissive standard: "the restraint needs to be reasonablyrelated to the integration,"246which is satisfied if the restraint "furthers the efficiency and successof a legitimate joint venture."247On the narrow issue of wording, the Commission subscribed to the "reasonablynecessary" language.248 Purportedbenefits from restraints of competition in products outside the scope ofa venture were not "cognizable," to use the wording of the Polygram structured analysis.249 More fundamentally, the Commission explained that no test could bless every restraint of competition that aided a venture, lest naked price fixing be justified as a way of achieving resources needed for some social good.250

Second, for cases not triggering the per se rule, respondents read California Dental Ass'n as requiring a showing of anticompetitive effects or the presence of market power before there is any burden of justification.251 Complaint counsel disagreed, arguing that "courts infer competitive injury from the existence of theinherently suspect agreement."252The Commission sided with complaint counsel, and, indeed, seemingly wouldnot require proof of competitive effects even for suspect restraints for whichthe respondent has a "legitimate justification."253

Third, respondents argued that it would be error to consider the anticompetitive consequences of the restraints alone, without regard to the larger venture;254 complaint counsel disagreed.255 The Commission's principal basis for decision was to side with complaint counsel and rule that restraintsoutside a larger venture cannot be justified by procompetitive benefits flowingfrom that venture.

Fourth, respondents argued that even if a presumption of anticompetitive effect is allowed, respondent can answer by pointing merely to a "'plausible' procompetitive justification"; thereafter, the burden should be on complaint counsel to prove net anticompetitive effects.256 Complaint counsel strenuously objected thatrespondents must show not only plausibility but "validity as well, and ifyou don't put that burden upon the respondents, then you don't have truncatedanalysis."257 The Commission choseto require not explicit "validity" (the Massachusetts Board term),but much more than mere plausibility.
